## Compatibility Requirements

### 1.

Generic components written for GG-Lite are also able to run in the GG-Java
environment. Generic components rely upon environment variables and the IPC
mechanisms for GG operations. These variables and mechanisms shall be compatible
between GG-Lite and GG-Java.

> Test by running a representative "complete" GG-Lite components in a GG-Java
> environment

### 2.

The IPC bus will be identical under GG-Lite as GG-Java

### 2.1

Generic components written for GG-Lite can communicate over the IPC bus hosted
by GG-Java

> Test by ensuring the complete GG-Lite component communicates via IPC

### 2.2

Existing components written for GG-Java can communicate over the IPC bus hosted
by GG-Lite

> Test by ensuring an existing component can communicate over IPC hosted by
> GG-Lite

### 4.

GG-Lite Components (not plugins) have the same lifecycle management

> Test by ensuring the test GG-Lite component receives each of the GG-Java
> lifecycle events.
