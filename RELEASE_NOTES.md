# Release Notes v2.0.0 (Dec 16 2024)

This is the first release of the Greengrass nucleus lite. It aims to be
compatible with the AWS IoT GreenGrass API and the previous Greengrass nucleus
implementations, however currently only a subset of the features are supported
with this release. Expect future releases to reduce the feature gap with
Greengrass nucleus.

In particular, only basic component recipe types are presently supported.
Detailed information can be found [here](./docs/RECIPE_SUPPORT_CHANGES.md).
